**Ultracode mode for Copilot Chat — inspired by Claude Code's Ultracode effort mode. Deep reasoning, agent tools, vision proxy, BYOK.**

Want Claude Code-level Ultracode effort but prefer staying inside Copilot Chat? This extension brings **Ultracode mode** to Copilot — powered by DeepSeek V4 Pro & Flash — with **vision**, **thinking mode**, and your own API key.

## Why this extension?

- **Ultracode mode for Copilot.** Inspired by Claude Code's Ultracode effort mode — deep reasoning, multi-step agent execution, and thoroughness you can count on.
- **Don't replace Copilot — power it up.** No new sidebar, no new chat UI to learn. Just a new model in the picker you already use.
- **Agent mode, tool calling, instructions, MCP, skills — all of it still works.** Copilot's entire stack, now running on DeepSeek V4.
- **Vision on a text-only model.** DeepSeek V4 can't see images. This extension proxies any image you drop into chat through another Copilot model you already have, then feeds the description to DeepSeek — transparently.
- **BYOK, pay DeepSeek directly.** Your API key, your bill, your rate limits. Stored in the OS keychain, never on disk.

## Features

### DeepSeek V4 Pro & Flash in the model picker
Both models show up alongside GPT-4o, Claude, and friends in Copilot Chat's model selector. 1M token context on both. Switch models mid-chat without losing history.

### Transparent Vision Proxy
DeepSeek V4 is text-only. Drop a screenshot into chat and this extension automatically hands the image to another installed Copilot model (Claude, GPT-4o, whatever you've got), gets a description, and feeds that back to DeepSeek. **Zero config** — just pick your preferred vision model once.

This proxy is a compatibility bridge; if DeepSeek native vision becomes available, the extension will move toward a more unified vision path.

### Thinking Mode with Reasoning Effort Control
Full support for DeepSeek V4's `reasoning_content`. Use Copilot Chat's native model picker menu to choose `none` (off), `high` (balanced, default), or `max` (deep reasoning for hard agent tasks).

### Inherits Every Copilot Capability
Because this plugs into Copilot's native provider API, you get the full stack for free:
- **Agent mode** — autonomous multi-step tasks
- **Tool calling** — file edits, terminal, workspace search, Git, tests
- **Instructions & skills** — all your `.instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and skills just work
- **Prompt caching stats** — DeepSeek's cache hit rate logged in the output channel so you can see the savings

### Secure by Default
API key lives in VS Code's `SecretStorage` (OS keychain on macOS / Windows / Linux). Never in `settings.json`, never in your Git history.

### Zero Runtime Dependencies
Pure VS Code API + Node.js built-ins. No Python, no Docker, no local proxy server to babysit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.116 or later. This extension relies on non-public Copilot Chat APIs that may break on newer VS Code versions — [report an issue](https://github.com/nolanrpg/ultracode-for-copilot/issues) if you hit one.
- GitHub Copilot subscription (Free / Pro / Enterprise — the free tier works)
- DeepSeek API key from [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com), or a compatible provider token when using a custom `deepseek-copilot.baseUrl`

### Installation

Install from the registry used by your editor:

1. **Microsoft VS Code** — install from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vizards.ultracode-for-copilot).
2. **Editors that use Open VSX** — install from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Vizards/ultracode-for-copilot).

### Usage

1. Run **Ultracode: Set API Key** from the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Paste your key or compatible provider token (official DeepSeek keys usually start with `sk-`)
3. Open Copilot Chat, click the model picker, pick **DeepSeek V4 Pro** or **DeepSeek V4 Flash**
4. That's it — chat away in Ultracode mode

## Models

| Model | Best For |
|---|---|
| **DeepSeek V4 Flash** | Fast everyday coding, quick edits, cheap iteration |
| **DeepSeek V4 Pro** | Complex refactors, agent tasks, deep reasoning |

Both support optional thinking mode, tool calling, and 1M token context.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `deepseek-copilot.baseUrl` | `https://api.deepseek.com` | API endpoint — change for self-hosted / proxied deployments |
| `deepseek-copilot.maxTokens` | `0` | Max output tokens (`0` = no limit). Useful for cost control |
| `deepseek-copilot.modelIdOverrides` | prefilled official ID map | API model IDs to send for DeepSeek V4 Flash / Pro. Change only for compatible third-party APIs with different model names |
| `deepseek-copilot.debugMode` | `minimal` | Diagnostic mode: `minimal` for token usage only, `metadata` for privacy-preserving logs, or `verbose` for full request dumps and pipeline snapshots under extension global storage. Full dumps may include sensitive prompt text, tool schemas, file snippets, and image descriptions. Use `Ultracode: Open Request Dumps Folder` to open the dump location |
| `deepseek-copilot.visionModel` | *(auto)* | VS Code vision model used to proxy images. Configure from `Ultracode: Configure Vision Proxy`; new saves use `vendor/id`, while legacy bare model IDs are still read |
| `deepseek-copilot.visionPrompt` | *(built-in)* | Prompt used to describe image attachments |
| `deepseek-copilot.experimental.stabilizeToolList` | `false` | Experimental. Tries to pre-activate VS Code/Copilot virtual tools so the DeepSeek API `tools` parameter is more complete and stable across turns. May improve context-cache hit rate when enabled tools change between turns. Can increase input tokens because more function definitions may be included; cache-hit input tokens are cheaper but still count toward usage. Usually leave it off with 64 or fewer enabled tools unless the tool list still changes across turns; do not enable it with more than 128 enabled tools |

Thinking Effort is configured from Copilot Chat's model picker for each DeepSeek model.

Example `settings.json` override for compatible API proxies:

```json
{
  "deepseek-copilot.modelIdOverrides": {
    "deepseek-v4-flash": "your-flash-model-id",
    "deepseek-v4-pro": "your-pro-model-id"
  }
}
```
